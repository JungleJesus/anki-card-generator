* Anki-card-generator

* What is it?
  I use Anki to learn new words and usually rely on Oxford dictionary
  to create flashcards.

  Anki-card-generator is a simple python piece of code aimed at
  automatically generating vocabulary flashcards from list of words by
  parsing Oxford dictionary webpages to look for word definition and
  examples.

  I also owe a SonyReader PRS-T1, which I use to highlight unknown
  words from text and books I am reading. So there is also a simple
  python script to extract those words from the PRS-T1 database in
  order to produce a list of words from which I can generate
  vocabulary flash-cards.
  
* Usage
  - run 'python -m prs-t1_annotation filename' to extract your annotations to
  filename as a list of words
  - run 'python -m oxford filename' to create 'oxford.txt' which can
    then be imported with anki from the word list in filename
